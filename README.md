# Lego-NXT-EV3-code
    Hello everyone! 
    Read this if you want to understand more about this project. 
    Now I'm on 3rd year of high school (finishing in 4 months).
    I build robots for 2 years on my school using lego-bots (NXT).
    And recently EV3 technology comes to my class, that was a great upgrade.
    For now, I'm building this one using two cores: NXT and EV3.
    I don't know thats is even possible, but I'm trying so bad. 
    Basically the robot will use an bluetooth communication with the 
    two cores. The NXT would be used to connect one or two more sensors
    on the robot for an catching obstacle. The NXT sends a message 
    on the mail box of EV3, which will be used to boot another 
    function on EV3.
